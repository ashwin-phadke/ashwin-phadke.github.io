# Personal Website

[UPDATE] :
- Changed the site to using Hugo with academic theme. Found out that academic theme was suitable for the site that was needed and was also customizable to a great extent.

- Know more about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) , [website theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/), [steps to deploy the site](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and [steps on How I deployed the site](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/deploying-to-github-pages/25997).

- More changes will be done soon to the site and final status will be posted when the site is complete with details. Meanwhile the site is live currently with basic data and you can take a peak.

- If you want to contribute or find something that is out of it's space do share.

Happy Coding!
